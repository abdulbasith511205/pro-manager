Problem Statement :
Many individuals and teams face difficulties in planning projects due to the lack of proper guidance on time estimation, team size, and budget management. Poor planning often leads to project delays, increased costs, and inefficient use of resources.

Solution Statement :
The proposed system is a chatbot that first collects detailed information about the project from the user by asking a set of important questions, such as project description, team size, budget, and complexity level. After gathering this data, the chatbot analyzes the information to estimate the number of days required to complete the project. It then provides effective solutions and useful advice to improve the project, including suggestions to adjust team members, optimize the budget, and resolve planning-related problems. This approach helps users make better decisions and successfully complete their projects on time
